# Car Price Prediction Analysis 🚗

This group project analyzes used car data to uncover key factors that influence resale value and price prediction.  
The project was completed as part of a hands-on data analytics training program and presented to a panel to demonstrate our Power BI and data storytelling skills.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze how features like brand, fuel type, mileage, engine size, and transmission affect car prices.
- Identify price trends and resale value by manufacturer and car model.
- Build a Power BI dashboard to support buyers and sellers in making informed decisions.
- Practice data cleaning, visualization, and dashboarding using real-world data.

## 📊 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – for data modeling and dashboard creation  
- **Excel** – for preprocessing and basic cleaning  
- **Kaggle Dataset** – source of 10,000+ used car records

## 📷 Dashboard Previews

> *(Insert screenshots after uploading to GitHub)*

- 📈 Average price by car brand  
- 🛣️ Price vs mileage & year  
- ⛽ Fuel type and price correlation  
- ⚙️ Impact of transmission and engine size on resale value

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Luxury brands like Mercedes and BMW depreciated faster than mainstream brands like Toyota.
- Diesel vehicles had higher resale prices on average but lower mileage efficiency.
- Manual transmission cars retained value better in lower price categories.
- Newer cars with lower mileage predictably commanded higher prices across all segments.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Buyers should consider mileage and transmission type as key factors for value retention.
- Sellers of premium brands should prepare for faster depreciation.
- Visual pricing tools can help both parties estimate fair prices.
